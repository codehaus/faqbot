Other development conventions for project FAQBot. 

1)  Please DO NOT ident text files using tabs, use spaces. 

2)  The length of a line of a line in a text file should not exceed 80 chars. 
    * The only exception is while pasting code snippets or command snippets 
    which can be copied verbatim by a user and used directly.

3)  Please javadoc all code - class headers, interfaces, methods (public, 
    private) and complex code blocks.
    TODO We should setup Checkstyle to enforce some of these.

4)  Please ensure code templates are setup generate source code header comments
    consistently with other code. 

5)  User @author $username and @revision $Id$ for Type headers to capture the 
    author and current revision info in a source artifact.

6)  To add SVN keyword substitions on a project, right-click on a project in 
    package explorer and choose to "Add Keywords". This pops up a dialog box to
    that allows the user to choose a set of keywords that could be used in 
    project source. Note we are using $Id$ as of this writing (see 5 above).
