
As postulated by Alan Turing:

An AI agent needs to have following capabilities:

* natural language processing to enable it to communicate with a human.

* knowledge representation to store information provided before or during the
  interaction.

* automated reasoning to use the stored information to answer questions and 
  draw conclusions.

* machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate 
  patterns.
